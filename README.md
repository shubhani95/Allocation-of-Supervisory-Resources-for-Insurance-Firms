# BOE_assessment: Allocation of Supervisory Resources for Insurance Firms

A Supervision Manager has asked for assistance in allocating scarce resources and determining which firms their team should concentrate on. Supervisory resources may be allocated based on a variety of factors, including firm size, changing business profiles, and outliers from the norm. To help with this process, certain metrics have been provided for analysis.

# Characteristics for Resource Allocation:
1. Firm Size: Larger businesses may require more attention due to their size and potential market impact.
2. Changing Business Profile: Significant changes in data year after year may indicate shifts in a company's operations or risk profile.
3. Outliers from the Norm: Firms that deviate significantly from the average within a single reporting period may necessitate further investigation to determine the reasons for the deviation.

# Provided Metrics:
The following metrics were provided for analysis:

1. Gross Written Premium (GWP): Insurer's total revenue written, equivalent to a non-insurance firm's turnover.
2. Net Written Premium (NWP): GWP minus reinsurance. NWP / GWP will indicate how much risk the firm is passing on to reinsurers.
3. SCR Coverage Ratio: A metric that indicates whether a company is meeting its prudential capital requirements. A ratio greater than 100% indicates that the capital is sufficient to meet the requirement.
4. Gross Claims Incurred: A significant cost for an insurer, so tracking changes over time is critical.
5. Net Combined Ratio = (incurred losses + expenses) / earned premiums. This ratio indicates a firm's profitability. A ratio of less than 100 percent indicates a profit.

# Notes:

1. Data Anonymization: The data has been anonymized with a random multiplier, which may result in unexpected patterns.
2. Metric Selection: While multiple metrics are available, it is not necessary to use all of them for analysis.
3. Outliers: Some data may contain outliers, which could be genuine or incorrectly reported. Distinguishing between the two is crucial.

# Tasks:

# Task I: Data Analysis and Reporting.
Using the provided data, a programming language will be selected to analyze the metrics and generate a short report with tables and charts to highlight firms that require attention.

# Task II: Machine Learning Insights.
Relevant machine-learning techniques will be used to extract additional insights from the data. These findings will be presented in an annex to the report.

# Task III: Cloud-Based Data Processing and Analytics Pipeline.
The report will be moved to cloud technologies, specifically Microsoft Azure, to create an end-to-end data processing and analytics pipeline that assumes daily batch processing of data. Considerations and tools used in this process will be discussed.

This repository aims to provide comprehensive support to the supervision manager in allocating resources and identifying firms that require attention via data analysis, machine learning insights, and a cloud-based data processing and analytics pipeline.

Note: The repository will include detailed implementation steps and code examples.
